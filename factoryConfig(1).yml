#FactoryMod configuration file

#FactoryMod is a Spigot plugin, which allows players to setup predefined factories for an item cost. There are various
#factories with different purposes and pretty much everything about them is configurable. Their configuration is 
#handled within this file. Take great care to ensure that your configurations follow exactly the documentation provided
#here, otherwise unwanted effects/crashes and run time exceptions may occur.

#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#Specifying items:

#Very often in this config you will have to specify items for a configuration. All item specifications are lists of 
#configurations, which contain information about the actual item, like this:

#inputmaterials:
#   inputmat1:
#       material: STONE
#   inputmat345FF:
#       material: DIRT

#Ensure that the identifer (here inputmat1 or inputmat345FF) all have the same intendation and never use duplicate
#identifers on the same level. Duplicate identifers which belong to a different configuration section are a bad habit,
#but should still work, while duplicate identifers on the same level will definitely not lead to the result you desire.
#This applies for every configuration option and not only for items. When you are required to specify a list of items
#you can also just put the option for it there, but not actually any identifers below it to list items and it will
#result in no cost/output.

#An example item config utilizing all possiblities could look like this:

#inputmat1:
#   material: STONE
#   durability: 3
#   amount: 456
#   name: SuperSpecialStone
#   lore:
#    - First lore line
#    - Even more lore
#   enchants:
#       enchantidentifier1:
#           enchant: SILK_TOUCH
#           level: 1
#       enchantgharbbl:
#           enchant: DAMAGE_ALL
#           level: 5


#material requires you to specify the type of the item. Use Spigot's official item identifers here, a full list of those
#can be found here: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Material.html

#durability allows you to specify the durability of the item. Note that this is not only limited to the durability of tools
#or armour, but instead the durability is also used to create different variations of the same material. For example orange
#wool is actually just white wool with a durability of 1. If this option is not specified it will default to 0, which is also
#minecraft's default durability for items. If you don't want to limit an item to a specific durability, but for example want to
#require any type of wool as an input, use -1 as durability. Make sure to only use this for inputs though, if you let a factory
#output an itemstack for players with a durability of -1, the item will be glitched. For a full list of all items and their 
#durabilities use this site: http://minecraft-ids.grahamedgecombe.com/

#amount allows you to specify the amount of the item, this isn't limited to 64 or whatever the maximum stack size of that
#item is, it can be any number (assuming it fits into an int). If not specfied this option will default to 1

#name allows you to define a custom name for this item, if this option is not set the item will have its vanilla name

#lore allows you to list lore which is added to the item. There is no limit to the lines of lore here, but after too many the
#minecraft client will stop display them properly. Defining lore is completly optional.

#Finally enchants allows you to list all the enchants wanted on this item, each enchant requires it's own config identifer.

#The two options requires per enchant are relatively straight forward, first of all you need to specify the enchantment type
#with it's spigot identifer. https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/enchantments/Enchantment.html provides a
#full list of those. Second you will need to specify the level you want the desired enchantment to be, this may exceed the
#possibilites of vanilla without causing problems.


#You can also create items with specific meta data, currently supported are anything storing potion data, dyed leather armour
#and custom nbt tags

#For potion data (so for potions, splash potions, linering potions and tipped arrows) you can specify an additional section 
#like this:

#examplePot:
# material: POTION
# potion_effects:
#   type: LUCK
#   upgraded: true
#   extended: true
#   custom_effects:
#     exampleEffect1:
#       type: SPEED
#       duration: 1m
#       amplifier: 1

#Each potion always has one default effect and as many additional custom effects as desired

#type specifies the look of the potion and the base type of effect that will be applied by the potion. Not all possible status
#effects can be used here, but only the ones that have PotionData, as listed here: 
#https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/potion/PotionType.html
#If not specified the type will default to AWKWARD

#upgraded specifies whether the default potion effect on the item is upgraded or not, per default this is false

#extended specifies whether the default potion effect on this item is extended or not, per default this is false

#custom_effects allows you to list other potion effects that are tied to this item, but don't affect it's item model, which is 
#determined by the primary potion effect

#To make dyed leather armour, two different formats are supported. The first one looks like this:

#exampleItem:
# material: LEATHER_HELMET
# color:
#   red: 255
#   blue: 0
#   green: 255

#The additional color section here has an option for each part of an RGB color, which is then applied on the item. All values
#must be within 0 and 255

#The other way to specify color of a leather item is directly through a hexadecimal number representing the RGB color like this:

#exampleItem2:
# material: LEATHER_BOOTS
# color: FF00FF

#Instead of using color as config identifier, you can as well just use it as option to directly specify the color in hex

#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#General

#This section allows you to define global default values and some general stuff. 

#Additionally you can specify default options here, which are applied to all factories which use this option, unless
#you chose to overwrite the default for a specific factory, in that case the option specified in the factories config 
#will apply to it.

#The first option here is default_update_time. The update time describes how often a factory is ticked, ergo how often
#it checks whether it still has enough fuel, enough other resources to run and so on. This is basically the smallest
#time unit within your factory can possibly react and all other time values your factory works with should be multiples
#of this value. If they are not a multiple of this value, their de-facto value will be the next higher multiple of the
#update time, simply because whatever effect they have can only be applied if the factory is actually ticked. Note that
#this value highly influences the performance of this plugin, if FactoryMod is consuming more server power than you want
#it to, the first step should be to make this value higher. Recommended value is 1 second

#default_update_time: 1s


#With the option default_fuel you can specify the default fuel for all factories which are consuming fuel in a furnace
#while running. This doesn't have to be a vanilla furnace fuel, but can be any item instead. A factory may chose to over
#write this option

#default_fuel:
#    charcoal:
#        material: COAL
#        durability: 1
 

#default_fuel_consumption_intervall specifies a default for how often factories consume fuel. Basically every time a 
#factory which consumes fuel has run for the time specified here, one fuel unit will be consumed. This value should
#always be a multiple of the updatetime and a factory may chose to specify it's own value and not use the default value

#default_fuel_consumption_intervall: 2s

#default_health specifies a default for how much health a factory has. Factories will continuously lose health over time and have
#to be repaired before they can be used again, once they are at 0 health
#default_health: 10000

#default_menu_factory allows you to specify the menu for which factory will be opened when a player runs /fm without 
#specifying a factory. If this is not specified and the player runs "/fm" one will be picked randomly.
#default_menu_factory:

#As a debug mode or to prevent additional information when tracking down bugs this plugin can log all of its inventory 
#interactions and the full inventories at that point, if desired. If this option is not specified it will default to true

#log_inventories: true


#Additionally this plugin can disable vanilla nether portals. This isn't really part of the plugin's core functionality,
#but it was picked up from the first implementation of FactoryMod and stayed here after it's rewrite. Deal with it.
#disable_nether: false


#When FCCs are in disrepair they will be removed after a set amount of time, which can be specified here
#default_break_grace_period: 7d


#How often factories are passively decayed
#decay_intervall: 1h

#How much health is decayed from factories by default each damaging run
#default_decay_amount: 21

#Whether the yaml identifier or the factory name should be used when assigning recipes to factories, default to false
#use_recipe_yamlidentifiers: false

#How often factory data is saved automatically. Recommended value and default is 15 minutes. Set to -1 to disable
#saving_intervall: 15m

#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Factories

#The main part of this plugin's functionality will be defined by this section as it specifies most of the configuration
#for your factories. Under the option factories you will be required to specify each factories configuration, each factory
#needs it's own identifier here, an example could look like this:

#factories:
#   IAmAnIdentifer:
#       type: FCC
#       name: Stone Smelter
#   SoAmI:
#       type: PIPE
#       name: Pipinator

#All factories have in common that they require you to define a type and a name. The type must be one of the predefined 
#options explained further below to specify the physical appearance and the broad functionality of the factory.
#The name can be any string, which will be used to identify this factory at a later point. There may be many different
#factories of the same type with different names with completly different configurations, but ingame factories with
#the same name are guaranteed to have the same functionality. Because of that NEVER EVER duplicate factory names, not 
#even if their type is different.

#Currently there are three different types of factories:

#1. FCC

#FCC is an acronym for FurnaceCraftingTableChest, which is the "classic" factory and what factories used to be in the first
#version of FactoryMod before its rewrite. As you might guess it consist of a crafting table, a furnace and a chest. The
#crafting table has to be in the middle between the furnace and the chest either vertical or horizontal. Those factories
#use an item which is burned in furnace as fuel to execute recipes, which usually use up some sort of item in the chest
#to produce another. A factory can have as many recipes as you want, the details for those are defined further down in the
#config. The identifier used for this type of factory in the config is FCC. An example config to explain every possible
#option for this factory:

#smelteridentiferbla:
#   type: FCC
#   name: Smelter
#   updatetime: 2s
#   health: 20000
#   grace_period: 14d
#   decay_amount: 40
#   fuel:
#       fuelidentifier:
#           material: COAL
#           durability: 1
#   fuel_consumption_intervall: 10s
#   setupcost:
#       dirt:
#           material: DIRT
#           amount: 64
#       stone:
#           material: STONE
#           amount: 64
#   recipes:
#    - Smelt iron ore
#    - Smelt diamond ore
#    - Smelt stone
#    - Upgrade smelter

#type and name work as already described above

#updatetime decides how often this factory is ticked to check whether it still has all the materials required, fuel etc.
#If this is not specified the default option which was specified above will be used. For more details on this option read
#the explaination next to the default updatetime above

#health determines how much health the factory has and how long it takes for it go in disrepair. If this option is not set,
#the default_health specified at the beginning of the config will be used

#grace_period determines how long the factory will stay alive while at 0 health. If the factory remains at 0 health for this
#time period, it will be permanently removed. Repairing the factory once will reset this counter and if this value is not set
#for a factory, default_grace_period as specified at the start of the config will be used

#decay_amount is the amount of health the factory loses every time factories are damaged by time based decay. The intervall for
#this damaging is the same for all factories and specified as decay_intervall at the top of the config. If no decay_amount is
#specified for a factory, default_decay_amount as specified at the top of the config will be used

#fuel specifies which item is used in the furnace to power this factory. You will still need to give the fuel it's own
#sub identifer here, because it's techincally part of a list of items. If this option is not set, the default fuel specified
#above will be used.

#fuel_consumption_intervall describes how often fuel is consumed if the factory is running with any recipe. If it is not set,   
#the default fuel consumption intervall specified above will be used.

#setupcost are the materials the player will need to create this factory. Two factories may not have the exact same setupcost,
#otherwise there is no way to determine which factory a player actually intended to setup.

#recipes is the option which defines what this FCC actually does, but you are only supposed to list the names of the
#recipes this factory is meant to run here. The exact functionality of the recipes is defined further below, ensure that the
#names given to the recipes are identical with the ones used here, even the capitalization has to be the same. The same recipe
#may be used by multiple factories or exist in the config without being used by any factory.


#Additionally it is also possible to upgrade factories, which turns the factory into a completly different one after a specific
#recipe. To do so, the upgraded version must be added to the list of factories with FCCUPGRADE as the type identifier. Example:

#upgradedsmelter:
#   type: FCCUPGRADE
#   name: Upgraded Smelter
#   updatetime: 2s
#   fuel:
#       fuelidentifier:
#           material: COAL
#           durability: 1
#   fuel_consumption_intervall: 10s
#   recipes:
#    - Smelt emerald ore

#As you can see this is pretty much identical to a normal factory aside from the type and the fact that an upgraded factory
#does not specify a setup cost. The actual upgrade cost will be contained in the recipe which is used to upgrade the factory


#2. Pipe

#Pipes allow players to transport items over longer distances. This is meant to replace hopper chains, which can have heavy
#impact on the server performance. The pipes themselves consist of a dropper, which represents the start point of the pipe
#and it's pumper, a furnace to consume fuel while transporting, the actual pipe consisting of stained glass blocks and a target 
#block with an inventory.

#An example config for a pipe:

#thisIsAPipeIdentifer123:
#   type: PIPE
#   name: Example Pipe
#   updatetime: 2s
#   setupcost:
#       redstone:
#           material: REDSTONE
#           amount: 64
#   fuel:
#       normalcoal:
#           material: COAL
#   fuel_consumption_intervall: 5s
#   transfer_time_multiplier: 1s
#   transferamount: 16
#   glass_color: 1
#   maximum_length: 32

#type for all pipes must be PIPE and name a unique identifer, standard stuff

#update time specifies how often this factory is ticked, see default_update_time for a detailed description of updatetimes
#functionality

#setupcost are the items required in the dropper when creating this factory

#fuel specifies the fuel the pipe uses up while transferring, standard as described above

#fuel_consumption_intervall specifies how often fuel is consumed, again this works exactly as described above

#transfer_time_multiplier defines how long the pipe takes to transfer one load of items. The total transportation time scales
#directly with the length of the pipe and the value specified here multiplied with the length of the pipe (only counting
#glass blocks) results in the total transportation time per batch. For example if you set this value to one second, a pipe
#which is 10 blocks long will take 10 seconds to transport a batch of items.

#transferamount is the total amount of items transferred per batch. 

#glass_color is the durability value of the glass this pipe is supposed to have. For a full list see:
#http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Stained_Glass#Block_data

#maximum_length defines how long this type of pipe may be at maximum. Length only counts the glass part here and this value
#may not be bigger than 512. Be aware that allowing many very long pipes might cause performance problems


#3. Sorter

#Sorters allow players to sort item from a single dispenser into different other containers. What gets sorted where is
#completly up to the player, the factory itself only consists of a dispenser and a furnace. The dispenser is the main block of 
#the factory which contains the items which will be sorted and the blocks in which will be sorted have to be adjacent to it.
#The furnace simply consumes fuel to power the factory, like it's done for other factories as well. An example config:

#fkIsGonnaLikeThis:
#   type: SORTER
#   name: The first sorter
#   updatetime: 2s
#   fuel:
#       normalcoal:
#           material: COAL
#   fuel_consumption_intervall: 5s
#   setupcost:
#       redblocks:
#           material: REDSTONE_BLOCK
#           amount: 64
#   sort_time: 2s
#   sort_amount: 32
#   maximum_materials_per_side: 20


# type, name, updatetime, fuel and fuel_consumption_intervall work all exactly as described above

#setupcost are the material requires when setting up this factory

#sort_time is the amount of time it takes for the sorter to sort one batch of items, where one batch is the sort amount specified
#in the config.

#sort_amount is the amount of items that gets sorted per run

#maximum_materials_per_side is an amount that limits how many items you can assign to a specific side (so the sorter sorts them
#in this direction)
